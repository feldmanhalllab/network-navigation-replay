Note: These data are not the fully raw data, but come very close.

Some of the raw data inadvertantly included information like IP addresses that could be considered sensitive and unsuitable for public sharing; the data in this repository have removed such information so that responses are fully anonymized. There were also a small number of subjects who had been noted as being noncompliant during the study session; their data were never analyzed, and additional subjects were recruited in their place to meet the target N. Those data are not included in the "source" datafiles here.
